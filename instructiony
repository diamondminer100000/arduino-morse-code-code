Connect the LED:
Place the LED on the breadboard (or connect it directly to the Arduino pins if youâ€™re not using a breadboard).
Connect the anode (the longer leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino.
Connect the cathode (the shorter leg) to one end of a 220-ohm resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND (ground) pin on the Arduino.
This setup will allow the Arduino to control the LED, making it blink in Morse code.
